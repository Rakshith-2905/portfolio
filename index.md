I am a Ph.D. student at Luminosity Labs, Arizona State University. I am privliged to be advised by Professors [Spring Berman](https://search.asu.edu/profile/1943720) and [Prof. Pavan Turaga](https://pavanturaga.com/). I am also fortunate to be mentored by [Dr. Jayaraman J Thiagarajan](https://jjthiagarajan.com/) a computer scientist at Lawrence Livermore National Labs. During the summers, I also had the excellent opportunity to work as a research intern at Stanford Research Institute ('20) and Lawrence Livermore National Lab for two years in a row ('21 and '22). I work on research that integrates computer vision and machine learning, with a focus on creating intelligent systems that efficiently use various forms of prior knowledge. My area of expertise includes **generative models**, **meta learning**, **few-shot learning**, and **object interactions**.
