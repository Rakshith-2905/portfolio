										<h3>About the Project</h3>
										<p>
                                            Google Lunar X Prize (learn more <b><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Lunar_X_Prize" target="blank" >here</a></b>) contestant Team Indus, based in India, laid out a challenge of their own when they secured the launch contract for their mission. They challenged students from universities around the world to design a lunar experiment weighing in at less than 250 grams in the form factor of a soda can to be launched with Team Indus’ rover for a chance to conduct new science on the surface of the moon. One of the many teams competing for this rare, lucrative opportunity to send something to the lunar surface reached out to  the Luminosity Lab for help prototyping and developing their experiment. I along with another designer at the lab took on the challenge.

                                <p>
                                    This experiment is aimed at learning more about the  process of photosynthesis in non-earth conditions. Photosynthesis forms the bases for almost all life on earth. We are interested in knowing if a proper photosynthesis can take place on the moon with its potentially hostile conditions. To test this we devised an experiment; we plan to conduct this experiment not with plants but instead we will be using  an extremophile bacteria called Chroococcidiopsis. This particular strain survived 548 days hanging outside of ISS in low earth orbit, and is considered to be one of the toughest photosynthetic organism ever found. It is theorized that cyanobacteria could potentially travel the universe riding meteors or comets. We decided to put it to the test in our lunar surface experiment. We will provide proper environmental and thermal conditions for the cyanobacteria to carry out photosynthesis with radiation being the only uncontrolled factor. We will have several duplicate experiments conducted simultaneously on earth to act as control data points. The experiment will then proceed to record certain chemistry information critical to the photosynthesis process. Once we’ve compared our results to the control on earth, we will have a better understanding of the differences between photosynthesis on here on earth and on the moon.

                                    We developed a cyanobacteria containment and monitoring system which would contain the cyanobacteria during the travel time to moon. The team has pulled together various strategies to protect the cyanobacteria from the harsh conditions of space which include severe temperatures, pressures, and radiation. For the monitoring the cyanobacterias activities inside the container the systems temperature, pressure, the radiation level, the CO2 level and the light intensities are being measured. When all the conditions are stabilized the cyanobacteria solution is released on a palette and is periodically stirred to enable culturing of the bacteria. The rate of consumption of the CO2 is monitored to estimate the culture size and accordingly more CO2 is released from a mini can. I selected the sensors for monitoring the system and designed a PCB on eagle to interface the sensors and the actuators

                                    A PCB was designed and prototyped containing all the sensors and the microcontroller board. An 32 bit ARM processor was used to log in the sensor readings. The data and power between the system and the lunar lander is transmitted using a D-Sub -9 connector.
